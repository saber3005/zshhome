Setup Instructions for the basic Vim environment using Vundle

Important: The vimrc is configured to autoinstall YouCompleteMe when setup.sh
  is invoked. This requires some extra configuration (see below) and can be
  stopped by commenting or removing line 30 from .vim/vimrc

Steps:

1. Preconfigure your system for YouCompleteMe (YCM) using the instructions here:
  https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#mac-os-x-super-quick-installation
2. Invoke .vim/setup.sh
3. Follow the post-install compilation steps for YCM.
4. ???
5. PROFIT!

Notes:

1. If you remove the line from the vimrc that installs YCM,
  you can ignore steps 1 and three.
2. The github page for Vundle (which is used in this environment) is available
  from https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim
